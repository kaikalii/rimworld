# Colonist Reproduction

There are two primary ways colonists can reproduce:

**Lovin'** between two fertile pawns with opposite sexes may result in pregnancy.
Pregnancy last 18 days.

**IVF** is a procedure that requires research. 
It involves removing a female colonist's ovum and having a male colonist fertilize it.
Once fertilized, one of three things can be done with the embryo:
- It can be implanted back into the mother
- It can be implanted into a surrogate mother
- It can be placed in a Growth vat

# Growth vats

Embryos places in a Growth vat take 9 days and adequate nutrition to produce a baby.

Any pawn below the age of 18 can be placed in a growth vat to age more quickly,
but growing a child in a vat prevents you from being able to choose their traits and passions.

# Inbreeding

Pawns will never (and cannot be persuaded) to romance anyone with whom they have a blood relation.

While IVF can still be used on blood-related pawns, it can cause the resulting child to have *Inbred* as a germline gene.
*Inbred* forces the *Slow Learner* trait and adds Fertility x50% and Immunity gain speed x85%.
The chance of this occuring is dependent on how close the blood relation is:

| Relationship                  | *Inbred* chance |
| ----------------------------- | --------------- |
| Parent/Child                  | 80%             |
| Sibling                       | 80%             |
| Grand parent/child            | 40%             |
| Aunt/Uncle/Niece/Nephew       | 40%             |
| Cousin                        | 20%             |
| Great grand parent/child      | 10%             |
| Grand aunt/uncle/niece/nephew | 10%             |
| Cousin once removed           | 10%             |
| Second cousin                 | 10%             |
